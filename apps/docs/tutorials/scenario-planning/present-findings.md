# Present Findings

Great analysis is only valuable if you can communicate it effectively. Let's create compelling presentations of your scenario planning results.

## Structuring Your Presentation

### The Planning Story Arc

1. **The Problem** - Current accessibility gaps
2. **The Proposal** - What intervention you're modeling
3. **The Analysis** - How you evaluated impact
4. **The Results** - What the data shows
5. **The Recommendation** - What action to take

## Creating Effective Maps

### Before/After Comparison

Export two maps showing:

**Map 1: Current State**
- Highlight accessibility gaps
- Show underserved populations
- Caption: "Current situation - 12,500 residents within 15 min"

**Map 2: With Proposed Facility**
- Show improved accessibility
- Highlight newly served areas
- Caption: "With new center - 18,200 residents within 15 min"

### Change Map

Create a single map showing the difference:
- Green areas = improved
- Intensity = magnitude of improvement
- Caption: "5,700 additional residents gain access"

## Key Visualizations

### 1. Population Impact Chart

Show how many people benefit at different thresholds:

```
           Baseline    Scenario    Change
5 min:      3,200       5,800      +81%
10 min:     8,400      12,100      +44%
15 min:    12,500      18,200      +46%
```

### 2. Equity Analysis

Show who benefits most:

| Population Group       | Accessibility Change |
| ---------------------- | -------------------- |
| Low-income households  | +52%                 |
| Elderly (65+)          | +48%                 |
| Families with children | +41%                 |
| General population     | +46%                 |

### 3. Cost-Effectiveness

Calculate efficiency metrics:

- **Cost per person served:** €438/person
- **Cost per accessibility point:** €37,000/point
- **ROI compared to alternatives:** 23% better than Option B

## Exporting Your Work

### From GOAT, export:

1. **High-resolution maps** (PNG/PDF)
   - Include legend, scale, north arrow
   - Use consistent styling across all maps

2. **Data tables** (CSV/Excel)
   - Raw accessibility scores
   - Population statistics
   - Comparison metrics

3. **Project files** (GeoPackage)
   - For sharing with technical colleagues
   - Enables reproduction of analysis

## Presenting to Different Audiences

### For Decision Makers
- Focus on **outcomes** not methods
- Lead with the recommendation
- Use simple, clear visualizations
- Highlight cost-effectiveness

### For Technical Staff
- Include methodology details
- Provide data and parameters
- Discuss limitations and assumptions
- Enable reproducibility

### For Public Engagement
- Use relatable metrics ("10-minute walk")
- Show familiar landmarks on maps
- Explain "what this means for you"
- Avoid technical jargon
