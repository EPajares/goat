# Introduction

Learn how to model "what-if" scenarios to evaluate the impact of new infrastructure, services, or urban development projects.

## What You'll Learn

Scenario planning is a powerful technique for urban planners and decision-makers. In this tutorial, you'll:

- Create and manage planning scenarios
- Add new features (buildings, roads, POIs)
- Compare baseline vs. scenario accessibility
- Make data-driven planning recommendations

## Why Scenario Planning?

Real-world planning questions need scenario analysis:

- *"What if we build a new school here?"*
- *"How would a new bike path improve accessibility?"*
- *"Which location for the new hospital serves the most people?"*

GOAT lets you answer these questions **before** committing resources.

## Prerequisites

- Completed Tutorials 1 and 2 (recommended)
- A GOAT account
- Understanding of accessibility concepts
- ~30 minutes

## Tutorial Overview

| Step | Topic                    | Duration |
| ---- | ------------------------ | -------- |
| 1    | Create a Scenario        | 5 min    |
| 2    | Add New Features         | 10 min   |
| 3    | Run Comparative Analysis | 10 min   |
| 4    | Present Findings         | 5 min    |

## Real-World Application

In this tutorial, we'll model:
> **"What if the city builds a new community center in an underserved neighborhood?"**

You'll:
1. Identify an accessibility gap using heatmaps
2. Add a hypothetical new facility
3. Measure the accessibility improvement
4. Quantify who benefits
