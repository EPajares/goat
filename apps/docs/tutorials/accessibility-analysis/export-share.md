## Creating a Professional Map Layout

For reports and presentations, include:

- [ ] **North Arrow** - Orientation reference
- [ ] **Data Source** - Credit your data
- [ ] **Date** - When the analysis was done

<div style={{ display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', alignItems: 'center' }}>
  <img src={require('/img/map/styling/legend.png').default} alt="Map Legend" style={{ maxHeight: "300px", maxWidth: "100%", objectFit: "cover", borderRadius: "8px", boxShadow: "0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.15)"}}/>
  <p><em>A well-designed legend helps readers understand your map</em></p>
</div>

## Best Practices for Sharing

:::tip For Stakeholder Presentations
- Use clear, non-technical language in titles
- Include a brief methodology note
- Highlight key findings with annotations
- Provide context (what does 15 minutes walking mean for residents?)
:::

:::info For Technical Reports
- Include coordinate reference system information
- Document all analysis parameters
- Provide raw data download links
- Add uncertainty/limitation notes
:::
