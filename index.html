              <p class="lead">        
                GOAT stands for Geo Open Accessibility Tool. This web-tool is meant to be open source, interactive, 
                flexible and useful for accessibility planning. It is under development at the Technical University of Munich (TUM). 
                Currently, GOAT is designed to assist pedestrians in movement from one place to another, however, frequent 
                enhancements and extensions will be made on a regular basis.</p>

            <h4 class="header-light regular-pad">Why GOAT?</h4>
              <p class="lead">There is rising awareness that active mobility plays a vital role in urban transport systems. 
                  However, to date there are few planning instruments that are focusing on walking and cycling. 
                  GOAT as an accessibility tool is therefore designed to model walking accessibility and serve as a 
                  suitable instrument for easier, better and more open transport and urban planning.</p>

              <p class="lead">        
                    The main focus of GOAT is to offer dynamic accessibility analysis at the neighbourhood level. At the moment, 
                    only the walking mode is supported but soon cycling will follow. With GOAT, you can calculate different accessibility 
                    indicators such as isochrones and gravity-based heat-maps. What is more special about GOAT is that you can develop your 
                    own case scenarios, for instance you can model a new bridge over a river, and examine corresponding changes in accessibility.
