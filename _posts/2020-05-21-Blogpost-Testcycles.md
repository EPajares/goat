By end of this year we aim to launch version GOAT1.0! To achieve a high usability and usefulness, GOAT is currently extensively tested by a group of experts in the fields of transport and city planning. Therefore, three test cycles in the form of workshops are carried out with practical users from the municipality of Fürstenfeldbruck in order to adapt GOAT to the needs of planners and to identify further development perspectives.

At the first workshop the participants got a detailed introduction into the tool GOAT and its possible extensions and applications. Afterwards the participants had one hour to try out the tool. The TUM project team observed the use of the web tool and documented the suggestions for improvement. Feedback was elicited through a round table discussion and an [online survey](https://www.umfrage.sv.bgu.tum.de/index.php/837925?lang=en) that we kindly invite all GOAT followers to answer. The participants confirmed the usefulness and the potential of GOAT in tackling different planning questions in a short amount of time. They also conceived that it is well suited for visualizing current planning issues, which can be used as an argumentation aid.

The practical experience of each workshop is incorporated into the development process. After each workshop, further development perspectives, suggestions and user’s feedback are evaluated and continuously updated and made freely available on the project website, so that an improved GOAT version is provided at each test cycle.

The second workshop started with a short presentation on the new version of GOAT and the focus was laid on the practical use of the tool by the workshop participants. For this purpose, tutorials were provided in the form of worksheets that allowed participants to test the new version of GOAT independently and to assess its usefulness and user-friendliness based on local planning issues. For this workshop, [a version of Fürstenfeldbruck](https://ffb.open-accessibility.org/) was provided, which was developed after the first workshop and contains all recent features such as cycling routing and scenarios on land-use changes. The GOAT-team helped with questions and observed and documented any usage difficulties that arose.

The third workshop was held, due to the current situation, virtually via ZOOM. This test cycle was similar to the second one. It started with a presentation on the new features and improvements of GOAT, which was followed by practical use of the tool by the participants. For this workshop, numerous new layers such as accidents, noise levels, protected landscape areas, and buildings and land use were presented. The GOAT-team intervened when the participants needed help. 

The participants suggested many good ideas for improvements. Among them:
- add additional POIs, such as children’s playgrounds and nurseries to GOAT
- consider the accessibility to green areas parks
- include information about nature reserves, etc. to get an better idea where for example a new bicycle bridge can be positioned 
- improve the printing feature
- provide additional data export options
- improve usability of the scenario building by providing a clearer workflow
- consider different gradients for the calculation of accessibility with a wheelchair
- provide the possibility to add new buildings as a new scenario
- differentiation between different types of wheelchair (e.g. electric and non-electric)
- enable storage and export of the developed scenarios


The suggestions for improvement were documented and will be, wherever possible, implemented in the further development process. We are already looking forward to the last planning workshop, which will be structured in small groups according to the subject area. The goal of this workshop is to process real planning issues. We are curious to see what valuable feedback the participants will give us this time.
