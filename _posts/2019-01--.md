- As highlighted in my previous post GOAT is by far not where we want to be
- besides an ongoing professionalization which is targeted to the overall project, new features are planned and will be implemented constantly
- the focus the months before this release, was mainly on improving the interactive network modification and the userinterface
- however there was little time invested in completely new features
- but there are envisioned edgecutting new features for GOAT, which shall bring GOAT to the status that GOAT 1.0 can be released 
- as funding for this first stable release is not secured and GOAT so far is still very much a personal project it is still undefined when this groundbreaking first release for production will be finished
- at the moment it is estimated that the needed development will need between one and two years
- I however see it as important to already communicate the potential features GOAT will have in the future and to show the direction 
- some features might be added additionally other probably removed 
- as this is an open source project and in general a very strong interaction with possible users is targeted I am also very open to discuss and consider input from the community. Just get in touch! 


- (There will be a table with the possible new features)

- besides the extensions highlighted major improvements in performance, accuracy and data quality are targeted
- The focus therefore is on improved data fusion concepts and also a stronger engagement in the OSM community
- everybody who has tested GOAT realized that the demo app is currently only available for the city of Munich, as our institution is located in Munich it is self-explaining that I started here, however an extension to other German municipalities and other places in the world is envisioned 
- although GOAT can be setup by everybody on it own server with his or hers study area many still want to be able to use GOAT right a way
- reasons for not covering other study areas are mainly related to the claims I have on the data quality but also on the ressources available for additional server space
- as OSM data can be of varying quality to use it in a production environment from my perspective cross-checks with other data source or the local knowledge are necessary
- furthermore I see activity in the local OSM-community as essential
- to the date I can only provide this within the city boundaries of Munich, in the coming months I can imagine to extent this to some other counties in metropolitan region of munich, however not yet to completely new places.
- However I would be very open to launch GOAT in other cities worldwide as part of cooperation with others. If you miss GOAT in your city and you are interested in becoming part of the community just get in touch and we could develop strategies to make this possible!
