- happy to announce that finally it is time for the first official release of Geo Open Accessibility Tool (GOAT)
- the release has the number GOAT 0.1
- people who followed the project know that the development on GOAT started with my Master thesis more or less one and half years ago
- the development of GOAT is seen as important part of the PhD I want to start soon and my daily work at the Chair for Urban Structure and Land-use Planning at TUM (Link to TUM will be added)

(Video with GOAT in action)

- it took time to come to the point that this first experimental release can be shared with you
- thanks to early adopters like my colleagues and students, countless hours Majk Shkurti and myself invested ==> GOAT matured 
- this first release is seen as first step, as GOAT is still very much work in progress
- accordingly there will be frequent enhancements and new features in the weeks, months and years to come

- this site should not only host the app GOAT but futhermore serve as contact point for the conceptual basis of GOAT and its documentation (Link to documentation)
- At the moment there is only very limited documentation at this site but frequent additions will be done  


- SUMMARY: give a short introduction on what GOAT is (it should be summary of background, what is GOAT and technical architecture


If you like this project consider giving it a start on Github.
