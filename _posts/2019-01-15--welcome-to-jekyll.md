I am happy to announce that time has come for the first official release of Geo Open Accessibility Tool (GOAT). This first version is labelled GOAT 0.1.
The people who have followed the GOAT project know that the development started way back with my Master thesis one and half years ago. Meanwhile the development became an important part of the PhD that I want to start taking soon and my daily work at the Chair for Urban Structure and Land-use planning at the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.sv.bgu.tum.de).

It has taken quite some reasonable amount of time to release this first experimental version of GOAT that can be freely and openly shared with you. I would like to thank early adopters of this concept, my colleagues and students, and especially [Majk Shkurti](https://github.com/majkshkurti) for helping me out when my front-end skills came to its limits.
This first release of GOAT is an initial step since GOAT still has numerous work in progress. This is to say that there will be frequent enhancements and new features in the coming weeks, months and years.
This site should not only serve the purpose of hosting the GOAT application but also play a vital role in acting as a contact point for the conceptual basis of GOAT and its [documentation](/docs/about). Currently, there is very limited documentation at this site but frequents additions will be done.
(Summary)
Geo Open Accessibility Tool (GOAT) is a flexible and interactive software used for accessibility planning. The main focus of GOAT is active mobility (walking & cycling). In a number of urban centres across the globe, active mobility (walking & cycling) take the largest share of transport activities (see Modal split in different cities worldwide).The GOAT tool is available for use anywhere in the world since it is open source.

One of the problems that GOAT is designed to assist in is urban accessibility and planning, especially when it comes to active mobility. It is evident that active mobility as a transport mode is not only less costly but also healthy. Decision makers and planners donâ€™t usually deliver expected results on matters of urban planning but with GOAT this might be a thing of the past.
The technical architecture of GOAT largely comprises of open source software, with libraries, programming languages and databases. GOAT uses the classical server-client architecture with PostgreSQL/PostGIS database as the main storage system. Operations in the database are done by procedural programming languages PI/pgSQL and PI/Python.
In GOAT, the web geoserver is used for sharing of geospatial data. At the moment, OpenStreetMap (OSM) data is the only kind of data used however other data sources and types can be inserted into the database for analysis purposes. 
This current setup was tested on an Ubuntu 18.04 machine but is available for other operating systems like Windows, Mac as well as other Linux Distros. 
If you like this project consider giving it a start on GitHub today.
