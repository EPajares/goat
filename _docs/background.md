### Active mobility matters!

While in the past walking and cycling were rather seen as insignificant, there can be observed a rising interest for establishing conditions that actively promote them. Regarding the not matchable benefits active mobility brings our cities, local economy, health and environment this trend is merely consistent.

Furthermore they generally already summarize a high share of daily trips done. As in Germany in many other countries walking and cycling already play an vital role in the everyday mobility (see: [Modal split in different cities worldwide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_share)).
In addition, it has to be underlined that walking and cycling are both crucial as feeders for public transport systems. However, it is evident that in many cities and municipalities worldwide the share of pedestrians and cyclists could be much higher and accordingly the positive impact harvested more extensive.

However planning for walking and cycling can be more complicated then expected. Besides an attractive infrastructure, a safe environment and a strong walking/cycling culture it is especially important to provide close destinations. This underlines the fact that fostering walking and cycling can not solely be reached by infrastructural projects but further requires an integrated approach of urban and transport planning.

### Modelling active mobility

Transportation and the urban metabolism are strongly interwoven and as consequence complex. Accordingly unsurprisingly planers and decision makers very often rely on the assistance of Planning and decision support systems. Among them are classically transport models as probably the most prominent representatives but also land-use and integrated land-use and transport models. They are generally used to assess the effect of large infrastructural or urban development projects.

Hence the ongoing development of the mentioned tools, they are rarely designed to model walking and cycling. The challenge lies in the necessity to model on the required high-resolution and the need to adequately consider small changes in the urban environment and transport network. Accordingly while for instance predicting the effect of a new ring road onto future traffic volumes might be possible, the effect of a new pedestrian bridge can be hardly quantified.

### Accessibility concept

The accessibility concept can be seen as potential remedy for this issue. Unlike transport models accessibility models can be used for all transport modes, scales and in addition can consider the interactions between transport and land-use. The accessibility concept in general is characterized by its high flexibility and extensive scope. Therefore unsurprisingly various definitions are existing in the scientific literature:

-*'the potential of opportunities for interaction' (G. Hansen 1959)*

-*‘the extent to which the land use-transport system enables (groups of) individuals or goods to reach activities or destinations by means of a (combination of) transport mode(s)’ (Geurs and Van Eck 2001)*

-*‘the number and diversity of places that can be reached within a given travel time and/or cost’ (Bertolini, LeClercq and Kapoen 2005)*

-*‘an expression of the potential number of relevant activities that are located within
acceptable reach of a given place or people in acceptable reach of an activity’. (te
Brömmelstroet, Marco et al. 2016)*

Unlike transport models accessibility models are showing potentials e.g. "How many additional jobs can be reached with a new transit line?" instead of trying to predict the growth of ridership due to a new transit line.

###### Accessibility components

With the so called accessibility components (Geurs and van Wee 2004) the accessibility concept can be further concretized. Each component can have an influence on accessibility, thus ideally all four components are considered. The access to supermarkets for instance could be influenced by the number of shops available (land-use), the quality of the transport network (transport), the opening hours of the supermarkets (temporal) and finally also by the financial budget of people (individual).

Nowadays there are existing countless ways for measuring accessibility and depending on the purpose, resources and data availability appropriate measures is chosen. Among the most used ones are gravity-based and contour measures. However there are existing also more complex indicators such as utility-based measures. Accordingly depending on the purpose accessibility can be measured with isochrones as relative simple catchment areas up to complex indicators considering utility models.

### Accessibility tools/instruments

For measuring accessibility tools are needed, they are termed as accessibility instruments or simply accessibility tools. Normally these tools are built with Geo Information Systems (GIS), that allow to process and visualize spatial data. There are existing numerous tools with extremely varying purpose, user-interface, user groups and terms of use.
Among them are in-house developments of research groups, open source projects but also proprietary software products. To the date there are only few tools existing that allow for dynamic calculations and ad-hoc scenario building. There are also only view tools specialized on active mobility.
