### Active mobility matters!

While in the past walking and cycling were rather seen as insignificant, there can be observed a rising interest for establishing conditions that actively promote them. Regarding the unmatchable benefits active mobility brings our cities, local economy, health and environment this trend is merely consistent.

Furthermore they generally already summarize a high share of daily trips done. As in Germany in many other countries walking and cycling already play an vital role in the everyday mobility (see: [Modal split in different cities worldwide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_share)).
In addition, it has to be underlined that walking and cycling are both crucial as feeders for public transport systems. However, it is evident that in many cities and municipalities worldwide the share of pedestrians and cyclists could be much higher and accordingly the positive impact harvested more extensive.

However planning for walking and cycling can be more complicated then expected. Besides an attractive infrastructure, a safe environment and a strong walking/cycling culture it is especially important to provide close destinations. This underlines the fact that fostering walking and cycling can not solely be reached by infrastructural projects but further requires an integrated approach of urban and transport planning.

### Modelling active mobility

Transportation and the urban metabolism are strongly interwoven and as consequence complex. Accordingly unsurprisingly planers and decision makers very often rely on the assistence of Planning and decision support systems. Among them are classicaly transport models as probably the most prominent representatives but also landuse and integrated landuse and transport models. They are generally used to assess the effect of large infrastructural or urban development projects.

Hence the ongoing development of the mentioned tools, they are rarely designed to model walking and cycling. The challenge lies in the necessity to model on the required high-resolution and the need to adequetely consider small changes in the urban environment and transport network. Accordingly while for instance predicting the effect of a new ring road onto future traffic volumes might be possible, the effect of a new pedestrian bridge can be hardly quantified.

### Accessibility concept

The accessibility concept can be seen as potential remedy for this issue. Unlike transport models accessibility models can be used for all transport modes, scales and in addition can consider the interactions beetween transport and landuse. The accessibility concept in general is characterized by its high flexibility and extensive scope. Therefore unsurprisingly various definitions are existing in the scientific literature:

-*'the potential of opportunities for interaction' (G. Hansen 1959)*

-*‘the extent to which the land use-transport system enables (groups of) individuals or goods to reach activities or destinations by means of a (combination of) transport mode(s)’ (Geurs and Van Eck 2001)*

-*‘the number and diversity of places that can be reached within a given travel time and/or cost’ (Bertolini, LeClercq and Kapoen 2005)*

-*‘an expression of the potential number of relevant activities that are located within
acceptable reach of a given place or people in acceptable reach of an activity’. (te
Brömmelstroet, Marco et al. 2016)*

Unlike transport models accessibility models are rather showing potentials e.g. "How many additional jobs can be reached with a new transit line?" instead of trying to predict the growth of public transport user due to a new transit line.
