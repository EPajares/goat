### Main characteristics

GOAT....

...is an interactive, flexible and useful accessibility instrument.

...focuses on active mobility (e.g. walking and cycling).

...allows you to model scenarios.

...can be setup for every place in the world.

...is open source and built completely with open source software.

...is highly customizable and extendable.  



### Why GOAT?

- active mobility plays a vital role for urban mobility
- rising awareness to properly plan for pedestrians and cyclists
- modelling the latter in transport models (they are not designed to model on the necessary fine resolution) is challenging and does normally not deliver the expected results
- planner's and decision makers however need support to properly plan and as consequence improve condition for active mobility
- accessibility models are very promising to fill this gap
- there are existing various accessibility tools but at the moment many of the still lack in the following aspects:
    - few of them consider active mobility
    - they generally allow no scenario building
    - tend to be hard or expensive to implement
    - few of them are open source 
    - they can be black boxes 

- Although GOAT is by no means perfect to the date, it tries to address these issues


### Planning Questions

Although GOAT is at an early developing stage it can already be used to answer different planning questions. 
Some example:

- How good is the walking accessibility to schools in different parts of the city?
- 
- How many residents are served by certain public transport stops? Where can be the perfect location for a new public transport, in order to serve as many residents as possible?

- What is the effect of an new pedestrian bridge on the accessibility in a neighborhood?

- How changes the accessibility if there is a temporary closer of an walkway?

- How high is the diversity and availability of gastronomy in different neighborhoods?

Many more and many will follow.

### Philosophy

- built completely with open source software and GOAT itself is open source (Licence GPL-3.0).
- GOAT can be modified and used by everybody (free of charge), also everybody can contribute 
- it is built with OpenStreetMap-data, which is available worldwide and free of charge
- however also other data source can be included with no issues
- is built modular, which allows easy extension and also scaling of the application
- developed as research project, accordingly state-of-the-art and innovative approaches are used
- the tool should be useful and help planners and decision makers
- involvement of the latter is focused and input is very welcome
