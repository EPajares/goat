If you find a POI with missing information in GOAT<sub>beta</sub>, you can edit it in OSM by clicking the "Edit with OSM" icon. 

<img class="img-responsive" src="../../img/OSM_POIs.png" alt="Link to OSM" title="Link to OSM">

This takes you directly to the corresponding POI in OSM.

Now you can enter the missing information or change information if it is incorrect, according to [Making changes in OSM](../osm_tutorial/).
